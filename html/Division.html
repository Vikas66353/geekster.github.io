    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
      web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such
      as JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h2>Css</h2>
    <p>
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
      multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
      appearance of the document.

  <div id="d3">
    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p>
      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
      of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
      maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
      presentational HTML since 1997.
